# Coronavirus Tracker Web Application

With the unfortunate circumstance, I have decided to develop a web application to track the current cases of the pandemic and provide visual data of the statics. I am still working on the design and optimizing for mobile-use and 4k resolution screen.

## Introduction

This application was developed with create-react-app. To load the page on port:3000, you must use Yarn Start.

## Live Site

This is the LIVE site - 

## API 

The API I am utilizing - <https://covid19.mathdro.id/api>

Unfortunately, the recovered cases where not provided globally, but the api did show recovered cases for each country.

## Chart Visualization

I used Chart.js to present the visual data in a line graph and bar graph.

## Component layout

I used Material-UI to conveniently design my components. This allows me to focus on the logic of the application as material-ui designs my responsive components

## Countup

With visual increasing number format, I have used Countup from react-countup
